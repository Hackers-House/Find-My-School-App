## Inspiration
We often end up wasting a lot of time searching for the best school for our kids-online and offline both. We also have different conditions and perspective towards which school our kid studies in. We all remember standing in those long lines for 3 hours just to get the application form and waiting for 4 hours or more to get the admission into a top tier college. We wanted to take this entire process virtually. From recommending the best college based on his interest and marks to providing an easy and safer way of managing student documents to a hassle-free way of applying to a college.

## What it does?
Find My School is an application built to make your hunt for the best school simpler by providing a platform where you can look for your dream institute. At one click you have access academic institutions around the globe the admission process is made paperless and hassle-free on the student end as well as the college end. Colleges and Schools and register with us and conduct the admission process virtually and all at one place. We are making a Flask web application, we are using collaborative filtering to recommend the best school This app facilitates you to shortlist, select and get admitted to your desired/dream institutions in the comfort of your home!!!
